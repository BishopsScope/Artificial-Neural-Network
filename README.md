# Artificial Neural Network from Scratch

## Underlying goals for this project
* Demonstrate a working knowledge of how each component works in an ANN by only utilizing the Numpy python library for the entire project (no ML libraries)
* Extensively document why each line of code is working the way it does and provide diagrams that support the architecture of how the code operates
* Allow a user to be able to specify the activation function, loss function, alpha values, number of neurons and more for each layer in the network
* Make training/testing fully automated by specifying the details of each layer, providing a large dataset and receiving details on updated weight values, loss values and training/testing accuracy
